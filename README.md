### Recommended for Default Agents

- [Official Fetch MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch#fetch-mcp-server): `uvx mcp-server-fetch`
- [Official Filesystem MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem#filesystem-mcp-server): `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`

## Config

The config folder contains relevant configuration settings for the CLI.

### Configuring Tools

Stdio MCP Servers can be added by updating the mcp.json file:

```json
{
  "secure-filesystem-server": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
      "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/" // Set an approved directory or it will default to /home/
    ]
  },
  "mcp-fetch": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
  },
  "sequential-thinking-server": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
  },
  "memory-server": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
  }
}
```

- To point to another mcp configuration file set `SYMPHONY_MCP_CONFIG=absolute/path` in your environment variables.

### Configuring Agents

Agent configurations are found in the `/config/agents` folder.

- To configure a new agent define it in an extended agents.md file and it will be automatically loaded into the CLI on start-up:

```yaml
---
name: Example Agent
description: Provide a brief description of the agent and what it can do.
model: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 # Pick a base model from the available models on artinet.io (defaults to Deepseek-R1)
version: "1.0.0"
skills: # Define the agents specific capabilities
  - id: example-skill
    name: Example Skill
    description: Give more specific descriptions of the kind of tasks your agent excels at.
  - id: demo-skill
    name: Demo Skill
    description: Make sure to accurately describe all of the agents capabilities to improve discovery.
tools: # Set the tools that the agent can use from the preconfigured stdio servers in your mcp.json
  - secure-filesystem-server
teams: # Assign the agent to a team and give it a role (lead {can call team members}/member {can be called by the team lead})
  - name: example-team
    role: lead
  - name: demo-team
    role: member
---
# Provide a detailed prompt for the agent that defines:
# How it should behave. (eg. "create a todo.txt file in your allowed directory and refer to it before..." )
# The scenarios in which it should call its available agents and tools (if any).
You are a helpful assistant that can...
```

- To point to another agents folder set `SYMPHONY_AGENT_DIR=absolute/path` in your environment variables.

### Logs

- Detailed logs of each session can be found in the the `artinet.log` file in the installation directory.
